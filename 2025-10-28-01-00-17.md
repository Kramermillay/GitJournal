aria2c(1)¶ %HEADING%aria2c1aria2c-1-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

SYNOPSIS¶ %HEADING%synopsissynopsis-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2c [] [||<TORRENT_FILE>|<METALINK_FILE>] ...

DESCRIPTION¶ %HEADING%descriptiondescription-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP /SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time, while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while downloading a file.

OPTIONS¶ %HEADING%optionsoptions-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Note

Most FTP related options are applicable to SFTP as well. Some options are not effective against SFTP (e.g., --ftp-pasv)

Basic Options¶ %HEADING%basic-optionsbasic-options-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

-d

,
--dir
=
¶

:   The directory to store the downloaded file.

-i

,
--input-file
=
¶

:   Downloads the URIs listed in FILE. You can specify multiple sources for a single entity by putting multiple URIs on a single line separated by the TAB character. Additionally, options can be specified after each URI line. Option lines must start with one or more white space characters (SPACE or TAB) and must only contain one option per line. Input files can use gzip compression. When FILE is specified as -, aria2 will read the input from stdin. See the Input File subsection for details. See also the --deferred-input option. See also the --save-session option.

-l

,
--log
=
¶

:   The file name of the log file. If - is specified, log is written to stdout. If empty string("") is specified, or this option is omitted, no log is written to disk at all.

-j

,
--max-concurrent-downloads
=
¶

:   Set the maximum number of parallel downloads for every queue item. See also the --split option. Default: 5

-V

,
--check-integrity
[true|false]
¶

:   Check file integrity by validating piece hashes or a hash of entire file. This option has effect only in BitTorrent, Metalink downloads with checksums or HTTP(S)/FTP downloads with --checksum option. If piece hashes are provided, this option can detect damaged portions of a file and re-download them. If a hash of entire file is provided, hash check is only done when file has been already download. This is determined by file length. If hash check fails, file is re-downloaded from scratch. If both piece hashes and a hash of entire file are provided, only piece hashes are used. Default: false

-c

,
--continue
[true|false]
¶

:   Continue downloading a partially downloaded file. Use this option to resume a download started by a web browser or another program which downloads files sequentially from the beginning. Currently this option is only applicable to HTTP(S)/FTP downloads.

-h

,
--help
[=|]
¶

:   The help messages are classified with tags. A tag starts with #. For example, type --help=#http to get the usage for the options tagged with #http. If non-tag word is given, print the usage for the options whose name includes that word. Available Values: #basic, #advanced, #http, #https, #ftp, #metalink, #bittorrent, #cookie, #hook, #file, #rpc, #checksum, #experimental, #deprecated, #help, #all Default: #basic

HTTP/FTP/SFTP Options¶ %HEADING%httpftpsftp-optionshttp-ftp-sftp-options-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

--all-proxy
=
¶

:   Use a proxy server for all protocols. To override a previously defined proxy, use "". You also can override this setting and specify a proxy server for a particular protocol using --http-proxy, --https-proxy and --ftp-proxy options. This affects all downloads. The format of PROXY is [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]. See also ENVIRONMENT section.

 
Note

If user and password are embedded in proxy URI and they are also specified by *--{http,https,ftp,all}-proxy-{user,passwd}* options, those specified later override prior options. For example, if you specified http-proxy-user=myname, http-proxy-passwd=mypass in aria2.conf and you specified --http-proxy="http://proxy" on the command-line, then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user myname and password mypass.

Another example: if you specified on the command-line --http-proxy="http://user:pass@proxy"` `--http-proxy-user="myname"` `--http-proxy-passwd="mypass", then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user myname and password mypass.

One more example: if you specified in command-line --http-proxy-user="myname"` `--http-proxy-passwd="mypass"` `--http-proxy="http://user:pass@proxy", then you'd get HTTP proxy http://proxy with user user and password pass.
 

--all-proxy-passwd
=
¶

:   Set password for --all-proxy option.

--all-proxy-user
=
¶

:   Set user for --all-proxy option.

--checksum
==
¶

:   Set checksum. TYPE is hash type. The supported hash type is listed in Hash   Algorithms in aria2c   -v. DIGEST is hex digest. For example, setting sha-1 digest looks like this: sha-1=0192ba11326fe2298c8cb4de616f4d4140213838 This option applies only to HTTP(S)/FTP downloads.

--connect-timeout
=
¶

:   Set the connect timeout in seconds to establish connection to HTTP/FTP/proxy server. After the connection is established, this option makes no effect and --timeout option is used instead. Default: 60

--dry-run
[true|false]
¶

:   If true is given, aria2 just checks whether the remote file is available and doesn't download data. This option has effect on HTTP/FTP download. BitTorrent downloads are canceled if true is specified. Default: false

--lowest-speed-limit
=
¶

:   Close connection if download speed is lower than or equal to this value(bytes per sec). 0 means aria2 does not have a lowest speed limit. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). This option does not affect BitTorrent downloads. Default: 0

-x

,
--max-connection-per-server
=
¶

:   The maximum number of connections to one server for each download. Default: 1

--max-file-not-found
=
¶

:   If aria2 receives "file not found" status from the remote HTTP/FTP servers NUM times without getting a single byte, then force the download to fail. Specify 0 to disable this option. This options is effective only when using HTTP/FTP servers. The number of retry attempt is counted toward --max-tries, so it should be configured too.

 
Default: 0
 

-m

,
--max-tries
=
¶

:   Set number of tries. 0 means unlimited. See also --retry-wait. Default: 5

-k

,
--min-split-size
=
¶

:   aria2 does not split less than 2SIZE byte range. For example, let's consider downloading 20MiB file. If SIZE is 10M, aria2 can split file into 2 range [0-10MiB) and [10MiB-20MiB) and download it using 2 sources(if --split >= 2, of course). If SIZE is 15M, since 215M > 20MiB, aria2 does not split file and download it using 1 source. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Possible Values: 1M -1024M Default: 20M

--netrc-path
=
¶

:   Specify the path to the netrc file. Default: $(HOME)/.netrc

 
Note

Permission of the .netrc file must be 600. Otherwise, the file will be ignored.
 

-n

,
--no-netrc
[true|false]
¶

:   Disables netrc support. netrc support is enabled by default.

--no-proxy
=
¶

:   Specify a comma separated list of host names, domains and network addresses with or without a subnet mask where no proxy should be used.

 
Note

For network addresses with a subnet mask, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses work. The current implementation does not resolve the host name in an URI to compare network addresses specified in [--no-proxy](heading://%HEADING%cmdoption-no-proxy%HEADING%). So it is only effective if URI has numeric IP addresses.
 

-o

,
--out
=
¶

:   The file name of the downloaded file. It is always relative to the directory given in --dir option. When the --force-sequential option is used, this option is ignored.

 
Note

You cannot specify a file name for Metalink or BitTorrent downloads. The file name specified here is only used when the URIs fed to aria2 are given on the command line directly, but not when using [--input-file](heading://%HEADING%cmdoption-i%HEADING%), [--force-sequential](heading://%HEADING%cmdoption-Z%HEADING%) option.

Example:  

```
$ aria2c -o myfile.zip "http://mirror1/file.zip" "http://mirror2/file.zip"
```
 

--proxy-method
=
¶

:   Set the method to use in proxy request. METHOD is either get or tunnel. HTTPS downloads always use tunnel regardless of this option. Default: get

-R

,
--remote-time
[true|false]
¶

:   Retrieve timestamp of the remote file from the remote HTTP/FTP server and if it is available, apply it to the local file. Default: false

--reuse-uri
[true|false]
¶

:   Reuse already used URIs if no unused URIs are left. Default: true

--retry-wait
=
¶

:   Set the seconds to wait between retries. When SEC   >   0, aria2 will retry downloads when the HTTP server returns a 503 response. Default: 0

--server-stat-of
=
¶

:   Specify the file name to which performance profile of the servers is saved. You can load saved data using --server-stat-if option. See Server Performance Profile subsection below for file format.

--server-stat-if
=
¶

:   Specify the file name to load performance profile of the servers. The loaded data will be used in some URI selector such as feedback. See also --uri-selector option. See Server Performance Profile subsection below for file format.

--server-stat-timeout
=
¶

:   Specifies timeout in seconds to invalidate performance profile of the servers since the last contact to them. Default: 86400 (24hours)

-s

,
--split
=
¶

:   Download a file using N connections. If more than N URIs are given, first N URIs are used and remaining URIs are used for backup. If less than N URIs are given, those URIs are used more than once so that N connections total are made simultaneously. The number of connections to the same host is restricted by the --max-connection-per-server option. See also the --min-split-size option. Default: 5

 
Note

Some Metalinks regulate the number of servers to connect. aria2 strictly respects them. This means that if Metalink defines the maxconnections attribute lower than N, then aria2 uses the value of this lower value instead of N.
 

--stream-piece-selector
=
¶

:   Specify piece selection algorithm used in HTTP/FTP download. A piece is a fixed length segment which is downloaded in parallel in a segmented download. Default: default.

 
default

:   Select a piece to reduce the number of connections established. This is reasonable default behavior because establishing a connection is an expensive operation.


inorder

:   Select a piece closest to the beginning of the file. This is useful for viewing movies while downloading. [--enable-http-pipelining](#cmdoption-enable-http-pipelining) option may be useful to reduce re-connection overhead. Note that aria2 honors [--min-split-size](#cmdoption-k) option, so it will be necessary to specify a reasonable value to [--min-split-size](#cmdoption-k) option.


random

:   Select a piece randomly. Like inorder, [--min-split-size](#cmdoption-k) option is honored.


geom

:   When starting to download a file, select a piece closest to the beginning of the file like inorder, but then exponentially increases space between pieces. This reduces the number of connections established, while at the same time downloads the beginning part of the file first. This is useful for viewing movies while downloading.
 

-t

,
--timeout
=
¶

:   Set timeout in seconds. Default: 60

--uri-selector
=
¶

:   Specify URI selection algorithm. The possible values are inorder, feedback and adaptive. If inorder is given, URI is tried in the order appeared in the URI list. If feedback is given, aria2 uses download speed observed in the previous downloads and choose fastest server in the URI list. This also effectively skips dead mirrors. The observed download speed is a part of performance profile of servers mentioned in --server-stat-of and --server-stat-if options. If adaptive is given, selects one of the best mirrors for the first and reserved connections. For supplementary ones, it returns mirrors which has not been tested yet, and if each of them has already been tested, returns mirrors which has to be tested again. Otherwise, it doesn't select anymore mirrors. Like feedback, it uses a performance profile of servers. Default: feedback

HTTP Specific Options¶ %HEADING%http-specific-optionshttp-specific-options-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

--ca-certificate
=
¶

:   Use the certificate authorities in FILE to verify the peers. The certificate file must be in PEM format and can contain multiple CA certificates. Use --check-certificate option to enable verification.

 
Note

If you build with OpenSSL or the recent version of GnuTLS which has gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust() function and the library is properly configured to locate the system-wide CA certificates store, aria2 will automatically load those certificates at the startup.  
Note

*WinTLS* and *AppleTLS* do not support this option. Instead you will have to import the certificate into the OS trust store.
 

--certificate
=
¶

:   Use the client certificate in FILE. The certificate must be either in PKCS12 (.p12, .pfx) or in PEM format.

 
PKCS12 files must contain the certificate, a key and optionally a chain of additional certificates. Only PKCS12 files with a blank import password can be opened!

When using PEM, you have to specify the private key via [--private-key](#cmdoption-private-key) as well.  
Note

*WinTLS* does not support PEM files at the moment. Users have to use PKCS12 files.  
Note

*AppleTLS* users should use the KeyChain Access utility to import the client certificate and get the SHA-1 fingerprint from the Information dialog corresponding to that certificate. To start aria2c use --certificate=<SHA-1>. Alternatively PKCS12 files are also supported. PEM files, however, are not supported.
 

--check-certificate
[true|false]
¶

:   Verify the peer using certificates specified in --ca-certificate option. Default: true

--http-accept-gzip
[true|false]
¶

--http-auth-challenge
[true|false]
¶

:   Send HTTP authorization header only when it is requested by the server. If false is set, then authorization header is always sent to the server. There is an exception: if user name and password are embedded in URI, authorization header is always sent to the server regardless of this option. Default: false

--http-no-cache
[true|false]
¶

:   Send Cache-Control:   no-cache and Pragma:   no-cache header to avoid cached content. If false is given, these headers are not sent and you can add Cache-Control header with a directive you like using --header option. Default: false

This option can be used to validate server's public key when SFTP is used. If this option is not set, which is default, no validation takes place.

BitTorrent/Metalink Options¶ %HEADING%bittorrentmetalink-optionsbittorrent-metalink-options-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

--select-file
=...
¶

:   Set file to download by specifying its index. You can find the file index using the --show-files option. Multiple indexes can be specified by using ,, for example: 3,6. You can also use - to specify a range: 1-5. , and - can be used together: 1-5,8,9. When used with the -M option, index may vary depending on the query (see --metalink-* options).

 
Note

In multi file torrent, the adjacent files specified by this option may also be downloaded. This is by design, not a bug. A single piece may include several files or part of files, and aria2 writes the piece to the appropriate files.
 

-S

,
--show-files
[true|false]
¶

:   Print file listing of ".torrent", ".meta4" and ".metalink" file and exit. In case of ".torrent" file, additional information (infohash, piece length, etc) is also printed.

--bt-detach-seed-only
[true|false]
¶

:   Exclude seed only downloads when counting concurrent active downloads (See -j option). This means that if -j3 is given and this option is turned on and 3 downloads are active and one of those enters seed mode, then it is excluded from active download count (thus it becomes 2), and the next download waiting in queue gets started. But be aware that seeding item is still recognized as active download in RPC method. Default: false

--bt-enable-hook-after-hash-check
[true|false]
¶

:   Allow hook command invocation after hash check (see -V option) in BitTorrent download. By default, when hash check succeeds, the command given by --on-bt-download-complete is executed. To disable this action, give false to this option. Default: true

--bt-enable-lpd
[true|false]
¶

:   Enable Local Peer Discovery. If a private flag is set in a torrent, aria2 doesn't use this feature for that download even if true is given. Default: false

--bt-exclude-tracker
=[,...]
¶

:   Comma separated list of BitTorrent tracker's announce URI to remove. You can use special value * which matches all URIs, thus removes all announce URIs. When specifying * in shell command-line, don't forget to escape or quote it. See also --bt-tracker option.

--bt-external-ip
=
¶

:   Specify the external IP address to use in BitTorrent download and DHT. It may be sent to BitTorrent tracker. For DHT, this option should be set to report that local node is downloading a particular torrent. This is critical to use DHT in a private network. Although this function is named external, it can accept any kind of IP addresses.

--bt-force-encryption
[true|false]
¶

:   Requires BitTorrent message payload encryption with arc4. This is a shorthand of --bt-require-crypto --bt-min-crypto-level=arc4. This option does not change the option value of those options. If true is given, deny legacy BitTorrent handshake and only use Obfuscation handshake and always encrypt message payload. Default: false

--bt-hash-check-seed
[true|false]
¶

:   If true is given, after hash check using --check-integrity option and file is complete, continue to seed file. If you want to check file and download it only when it is damaged or incomplete, set this option to false. This option has effect only on BitTorrent download. Default: true

--bt-load-saved-metadata
[true|false]
¶

:   Before getting torrent metadata from DHT when downloading with magnet link, first try to read file saved by --bt-save-metadata option. If it is successful, then skip downloading metadata from DHT. Default: false

--bt-min-crypto-level
=plain|arc4
¶

:   Set minimum level of encryption method. If several encryption methods are provided by a peer, aria2 chooses the lowest one which satisfies the given level. Default: plain

--bt-prioritize-piece
=head[=],tail[=]
¶

:   Try to download first and last pieces of each file first. This is useful for previewing files. The argument can contain 2 keywords: head and tail. To include both keywords, they must be separated by comma. These keywords can take one parameter, SIZE. For example, if head= is specified, pieces in the range of first SIZE bytes of each file get higher priority. tail= means the range of last SIZE bytes of each file. SIZE can include K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). If SIZE is omitted, SIZE=1M is used.

--bt-remove-unselected-file
[true|false]
¶

:   Removes the unselected files when download is completed in BitTorrent. To select files, use --select-file option. If it is not used, all files are assumed to be selected. Please use this option with care because it will actually remove files from your disk. Default: false

--bt-require-crypto
[true|false]
¶

:   If true is given, aria2 doesn't accept and establish connection with legacy BitTorrent handshake(\19BitTorrent protocol). Thus aria2 always uses Obfuscation handshake. Default: false

--bt-request-peer-speed-limit
=
¶

:   If the whole download speed of every torrent is lower than SPEED, aria2 temporarily increases the number of peers to try for more download speed. Configuring this option with your preferred download speed can increase your download speed in some cases. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 50K

--bt-save-metadata
[true|false]
¶

:   Save metadata as ".torrent" file. This option has effect only when BitTorrent Magnet URI is used. The file name is hex encoded info hash with suffix ".torrent". The directory to be saved is the same directory where download file is saved. If the same file already exists, metadata is not saved. See also --bt-metadata-only option. Default: false

--bt-seed-unverified
[true|false]
¶

:   Seed previously downloaded files without verifying piece hashes. Default: false

--bt-stop-timeout
=
¶

:   Stop BitTorrent download if download speed is 0 in consecutive SEC seconds. If 0 is given, this feature is disabled. Default: 0

--bt-tracker
=[,...]
¶

¶

:   Set the connect timeout in seconds to establish connection to tracker. After the connection is established, this option makes no effect and --bt-tracker-timeout option is used instead. Default: 60

--bt-tracker-interval
=
¶

:   Set the interval in seconds between tracker requests. This completely overrides interval value and aria2 just uses this value and ignores the min interval and interval value in the response of tracker. If 0 is set, aria2 determines interval based on the response of tracker and the download progress. Default: 0

--bt-tracker-timeout
=
¶

:   Set timeout in seconds. Default: 60

Note

*WinTLS* does not support PEM files at the moment. Users have to use PKCS12 files.  
Note

*AppleTLS* users should use the KeyChain Access utility to first generate a self-signed SSL-Server certificate, e.g. using the wizard, and get the SHA-1 fingerprint from the Information dialog corresponding to that new certificate. To start aria2c with [--rpc-secure](#cmdoption-rpc-secure) use --rpc-certificate=<SHA-1>. Alternatively PKCS12 files are also supported. PEM files, however, are not supported.

If false is given to this option, the downloads added by aria2.addTorrent() or aria2.addMetalink() will not be saved by --save-session option. Default: true

--rpc-secret
=
¶

:   Set RPC secret authorization token. Read RPC authorization secret token to know how this option value is used.

--rpc-secure
[true|false]
¶

:   RPC transport will be encrypted by SSL/TLS. The RPC clients must use https scheme to access the server. For WebSocket client, use wss scheme. Use --rpc-certificate and --rpc-private-key options to specify the server certificate and private key.

=
¶

:   Save a control file(*.aria2) every SEC seconds. If 0 is given, a control file is not saved during download. aria2 saves a control file when it stops regardless of the value. The possible values are between 0 to 600. Default: 60

--conditional-get
[true|false]
¶

:   Download file only when the local file is older than remote file. This function only works with HTTP(S) downloads only. It does not work if file size is specified in Metalink. It also ignores Content-Disposition header. If a control file exists, this option will be ignored. This function uses If-Modified-Since header to get only newer file conditionally. When getting modification time of local file, it uses user supplied file name (see --out option) or file name part in URI if --out is not specified. To overwrite existing file, --allow-overwrite is required. Default: false

--conf-path
=
¶

:   Change the configuration file path to PATH. Default: $HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf if present, otherwise $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf.

--console-log-level
=
¶

:   Set log level to output to console. LEVEL is either debug, info, notice, warn or error. Default: notice

--content-disposition-default-utf8
[true|false]
¶

:   Handle quoted string in Content-Disposition header as UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1, for example, the filename parameter, but not the extended version filename*. Default: false

-D

,
--daemon
[true|false]
¶

:   Run as daemon. The current working directory will be changed to / and standard input, standard output and standard error will be redirected to /dev/null. Default: false

--deferred-input
[true|false]
¶

:   If true is given, aria2 does not read all URIs and options from file specified by --input-file option at startup, but it reads one by one when it needs later. This may reduce memory usage if input file contains a lot of URIs to download. If false is given, aria2 reads all URIs and options at startup. Default: false

--disable-ipv6
[true|false]
¶

:   Disable IPv6. This is useful if you have to use broken DNS and want to avoid terribly slow AAAA record lookup. Default: false

--disk-cache
=
¶

:   Enable disk cache. If SIZE is 0, the disk cache is disabled. This feature caches the downloaded data in memory, which grows to at most SIZE bytes. The cache storage is created for aria2 instance and shared by all downloads. The one advantage of the disk cache is reduce the disk I/O because the data are written in larger unit and it is reordered by the offset of the file. If hash checking is involved and the data are cached in memory, we don't need to read them from the disk. SIZE can include K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 16M

--download-result
=
¶

:   This option changes the way Download   Results is formatted. If OPT is default, print GID, status, average download speed and path/URI. If multiple files are involved, path/URI of first requested file is printed and remaining ones are omitted. If OPT is full, print GID, status, average download speed, percentage of progress and path/URI. The percentage of progress and path/URI are printed for each requested file in each row. If OPT is hide, Download   Results is hidden. Default: default

--dscp
=
¶

:   Set DSCP value in outgoing IP packets of BitTorrent traffic for QoS. This parameter sets only DSCP bits in TOS field of IP packets, not the whole field. If you take values from /usr/include/netinet/ip.h divide them by 4 (otherwise values would be incorrect, e.g. your CS1 class would turn into CS4). If you take commonly used values from RFC, network vendors' documentation, Wikipedia or any other source, use them as they are.

--rlimit-nofile
=
¶

:   Set the soft limit of open file descriptors. This open will only have effect when:

 
> 1. The system supports it (posix)
>
> 2. The limit does not exceed the hard limit.
>
> 3. The specified limit is larger than the current soft limit.

This is equivalent to setting nofile via ulimit, except that it will never decrease the limit.

This option is only available on systems supporting the rlimit API.
 

--enable-color
[true|false]
¶

:   Enable color output for a terminal. Default: true

--enable-mmap
[true|false]
¶

:   Map files into memory. This option may not work if the file space is not pre-allocated. See --file-allocation.

 
Default: false
 

--event-poll
=
¶

:   Specify the method for polling events. The possible values are epoll, kqueue, port, poll and select. For each epoll, kqueue, port and poll, it is available if system supports it. epoll is available on recent Linux. kqueue is available on various *BSD systems including Mac OS X. port is available on Open Solaris. The default value may vary depending on the system you use.

--file-allocation
=
¶

:   Specify file allocation method. none doesn't pre-allocate file space. prealloc pre-allocates file space before download begins. This may take some time depending on the size of the file. If you are using newer file systems such as ext4 (with extents support), btrfs, xfs or NTFS(MinGW build only), falloc is your best choice. It allocates large(few GiB) files almost instantly. Don't use falloc with legacy file systems such as ext3 and FAT32 because it takes almost the same time as prealloc and it blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes. falloc may not be available if your system doesn't have posix_fallocate(3) function. trunc uses ftruncate(2) system call or platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file to a specified length.

 
Possible Values: none, prealloc, trunc, falloc Default: prealloc  
Warning

Using trunc seemingly allocates disk space very quickly, but what it actually does is that it sets file length metadata in file system, and does not allocate disk space at all. This means that it does not help avoiding fragmentation.  
Note

In multi file torrent downloads, the files adjacent forward to the specified files are also allocated if they share the same piece.
 

--force-save
[true|false]
¶

:   Save download with --save-session option even if the download is completed or removed. This option also saves control file in that situations. This may be useful to save BitTorrent seeding which is recognized as completed state. Default: false

--save-not-found
[true|false]
¶

:   Save download with --save-session option even if the file was not found on the server. This option also saves control file in that situations. Default: true

--gid
=
¶

:   Set GID manually. aria2 identifies each download by the ID called GID. The GID must be hex string of 16 characters, thus [0-9a-fA-F] are allowed and leading zeros must not be stripped. The GID all 0 is reserved and must not be used. The GID must be unique, otherwise error is reported and the download is not added. This option is useful when restoring the sessions saved using --save-session option. If this option is not used, new GID is generated by aria2.

--hash-check-only
[true|false]
¶

:   If true is given, after hash check using --check-integrity option, abort download whether or not download is complete. Default: false

--human-readable
[true|false]
¶

:   Print sizes and speed in human readable format (e.g., 1.2Ki, 3.4Mi) in the console readout. Default: true

--interface
=
¶

:   Bind sockets to given interface. You can specify interface name, IP address and host name. Possible Values: interface, IP address, host name

 
Note

If an interface has multiple addresses, it is highly recommended to specify IP address explicitly. See also [--disable-ipv6](#cmdoption-disable-ipv6). If your system doesn't have *getifaddrs(3)*, this option doesn't accept interface name.
 

--keep-unfinished-download-result
[true|false]
¶

:   Keep unfinished download results even if doing so exceeds --max-download-result. This is useful if all unfinished downloads must be saved in session file (see --save-session option). Please keep in mind that there is no upper bound to the number of unfinished download result to keep. If that is undesirable, turn this option off. Default: true

--max-download-result
=
¶

:   Set maximum number of download result kept in memory. The download results are completed/error/removed downloads. The download results are stored in FIFO queue and it can store at most NUM download results. When queue is full and new download result is created, oldest download result is removed from the front of the queue and new one is pushed to the back. Setting big number in this option may result high memory consumption after thousands of downloads. Specifying 0 means no download result is kept. Note that unfinished downloads are kept in memory regardless of this option value. See --keep-unfinished-download-result option. Default: 1000

--max-mmap-limit
=
¶

:   Set the maximum file size to enable mmap (see --enable-mmap option). The file size is determined by the sum of all files contained in one download. For example, if a download contains 5 files, then file size is the total size of those files. If file size is strictly greater than the size specified in this option, mmap will be disabled. Default: 9223372036854775807

--max-resume-failure-tries
=
¶

:   When used with --always-resume=false, aria2 downloads file from scratch when aria2 detects N number of URIs that does not support resume. If N is 0, aria2 downloads file from scratch when all given URIs do not support resume. See --always-resume option. Default: 0

--min-tls-version
=
¶

:   Specify minimum SSL/TLS version to enable. Possible Values: TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 Default: TLSv1.2

--multiple-interface
=
¶

:   Comma separated list of interfaces to bind sockets to. Requests will be split among the interfaces to achieve link aggregation. You can specify interface name, IP address and hostname. If --interface is used, this option will be ignored. Possible Values: interface, IP address, hostname

--log-level
=
¶

:   Set log level to output. LEVEL is either debug, info, notice, warn or error. Default: debug

--on-bt-download-complete
=
¶

:   For BitTorrent, a command specified in --on-download-complete is called after download completed and seeding is over. On the other hand, this option set the command to be executed after download completed but before seeding. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--on-download-complete
=
¶

:   Set the command to be executed after download completed. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. See also --on-download-stop option. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--on-download-error
=
¶

:   Set the command to be executed after download aborted due to error. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. See also --on-download-stop option. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--on-download-pause
=
¶

:   Set the command to be executed after download was paused. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--on-download-start
=
¶

:   Set the command to be executed after download got started. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--on-download-stop
=
¶

:   Set the command to be executed after download stopped. You can override the command to be executed for particular download result using --on-download-complete and --on-download-error. If they are specified, command specified in this option is not executed. See Event Hook for more details about COMMAND. Possible Values: /path/to/command

--optimize-concurrent-downloads
[true|false|:]
¶

:   Optimizes the number of concurrent downloads according to the bandwidth available. aria2 uses the download speed observed in the previous downloads to adapt the number of downloads launched in parallel according to the rule N = A + B Log10(speed in Mbps). The coefficients A and B can be customized in the option arguments with A and B separated by a colon. The default values (A=5, B=25) lead to using typically 5 parallel downloads on 1Mbps networks and above 50 on 100Mbps networks. The number of parallel downloads remains constrained under the maximum defined by the --max-concurrent-downloads parameter. Default: false

--piece-length
=
¶

:   Set a piece length for HTTP/FTP downloads. This is the boundary when aria2 splits a file. All splits occur at multiple of this length. This option will be ignored in BitTorrent downloads. It will be also ignored if Metalink file contains piece hashes. Default: 1M

--show-console-readout
[true|false]
¶

:   Show console readout. Default: true

--stderr
[true|false]
¶

:   Redirect all console output that would be otherwise printed in stdout to stderr. Default: false

--summary-interval
=
¶

:   Set interval in seconds to output download progress summary. Setting 0 suppresses the output. Default: 60

-Z

,
--force-sequential
[true|false]
¶

:   Fetch URIs in the command-line sequentially and download each URI in a separate session, like the usual command-line download utilities. Default: false

--max-overall-download-limit
=
¶

:   Set max overall download speed in bytes/sec. 0 means unrestricted. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). To limit the download speed per download, use --max-download-limit option. Default: 0

--max-download-limit
=
¶

:   Set max download speed per each download in bytes/sec. 0 means unrestricted. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). To limit the overall download speed, use --max-overall-download-limit option. Default: 0

--no-conf
[true|false]
¶

:   Disable loading aria2.conf file.

--no-file-allocation-limit
=
¶

:   No file allocation is made for files whose size is smaller than SIZE. You can append K or M (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: 5M

-P

,
--parameterized-uri
[true|false]
¶

:   Enable parameterized URI support. You can specify set of parts: http://{sv1,sv2,sv3}/foo.iso. Also you can specify numeric sequences with step counter: http://host/image[000-100:2].img. A step counter can be omitted. If all URIs do not point to the same file, such as the second example above, -Z option is required. Default: false

-q

,
--quiet
[true|false]
¶

:   Make aria2 quiet (no console output). Default: false

--realtime-chunk-checksum
[true|false]
¶

:   Validate chunk of data by calculating checksum while downloading a file if chunk checksums are provided. Default: true

--remove-control-file
[true|false]
¶

:   Remove control file before download. Using with --allow-overwrite=true, download always starts from scratch. This will be useful for users behind proxy server which disables resume.

--save-session
=
¶

:   Save error/unfinished downloads to FILE on exit. You can pass this output file to aria2c with --input-file option on restart. If you like the output to be gzipped append a .gz extension to the file name. Please note that downloads added by aria2.addTorrent() and aria2.addMetalink() RPC method and whose metadata could not be saved as a file are not saved. Downloads removed using aria2.remove() and aria2.forceRemove() will not be saved. GID is also saved with gid, but there are some restrictions, see below.

 
Note

Normally, GID of the download itself is saved. But some downloads use metadata (e.g., BitTorrent and Metalink). In this case, there are some restrictions.


magnet URI, and followed by torrent download

:   GID of BitTorrent metadata download is saved.


URI to torrent file, and followed by torrent download

:   GID of torrent file download is saved.


URI to metalink file, and followed by file downloads described in metalink file

:   GID of metalink file download is saved.


local torrent file

:   GID of torrent download is saved.


local metalink file

:   Any meaningful GID is not saved.
 

--save-session-interval
=
¶

:   Save error/unfinished downloads to a file specified by --save-session option every SEC seconds. If 0 is given, file will be saved only when aria2 exits. Default: 0

--socket-recv-buffer-size
=
¶

:   Set the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes. Specifying 0 will disable this option. This value will be set to socket file descriptor using SO_RCVBUF socket option with setsockopt() call. Default: 0

--stop
=
¶

:   Stop application after SEC seconds has passed. If 0 is given, this feature is disabled. Default: 0

--stop-with-process
=
¶

:   Stop application when process PID is not running. This is useful if aria2 process is forked from a parent process. The parent process can fork aria2 with its own pid and when parent process exits for some reason, aria2 can detect it and shutdown itself.

--truncate-console-readout
[true|false]
¶

:   Truncate console readout to fit in a single line. Default: true

-v

,
--version

¶

:   Print the version number, copyright and the configuration information and exit.

Notes for Options¶ %HEADING%notes-for-optionsnotes-for-options-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Optional arguments¶ %HEADING%optional-argumentsoptional-arguments-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

The options that have its argument surrounded by square brackets([]) take an optional argument. Usually omitting the argument is evaluated to true. If you use short form of these options(such as -V) and give an argument, then the option name and its argument should be concatenated(e.g. -Vfalse). If any spaces are inserted between the option name and the argument, the argument will be treated as URI and usually this is not what you expect.

Units (K and M)¶ %HEADING%units-k-and-munits-k-and-m-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Some options takes K and M to conveniently represent 1024 and 1048576 respectively. aria2 detects these characters in case-insensitive way. In other words, k and m can be used as well as K and M respectively.

URI, MAGNET, TORRENT_FILE, METALINK_FILE¶ %HEADING%uri-magnet-torrent_file-metalink_fileuri-magnet-torrent-file-metalink-file-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

You can specify multiple URIs in command-line. Unless you specify --force-sequential option, all URIs must point to the same file or downloading will fail.

You can specify arbitrary number of BitTorrent Magnet URI. Please note that they are always treated as a separate download. Both hex encoded 40 characters Info Hash and Base32 encoded 32 characters Info Hash are supported. The multiple tr parameters are supported. Because BitTorrent Magnet URI is likely to contain & character, it is highly recommended to always quote URI with single(') or double(") quotation. It is strongly recommended to enable DHT especially when tr parameter is missing. See http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html for more details about BitTorrent Magnet URI.

You can also specify arbitrary number of torrent files and Metalink documents stored on a local drive. Please note that they are always treated as a separate download. Both Metalink4 and Metalink version 3.0 are supported.

You can specify both torrent file with -T option and URIs. By doing this, you can download a file from both torrent swarm and HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP server at the same time, while the data from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP are uploaded to the torrent swarm. For single file torrents, URI can be a complete URI pointing to the resource or if URI ends with /, name in torrent file in torrent is added. For multi-file torrents, name and path are added to form a URI for each file.
Note

Make sure that URI is quoted with single(') or double(") quotation if it contains & or any characters that have special meaning in shell.

Resuming Download¶ %HEADING%resuming-downloadresuming-download-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Usually, you can resume transfer by just issuing same command (aria2c URI) if the previous transfer is made by aria2.

If the previous transfer is made by a browser or wget like sequential download manager, then use --continue option to continue the transfer.

Event Hook¶ %HEADING%event-hookevent-hook-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2 provides options to specify arbitrary command after specific event occurred. Currently following options are available: --on-bt-download-complete, --on-download-pause, --on-download-complete. --on-download-start, --on-download-error, --on-download-stop.

aria2 passes 3 arguments to specified command when it is executed. These arguments are: GID, the number of files and file path. For HTTP, FTP, and SFTP downloads, usually the number of files is 1. BitTorrent download can contain multiple files. If number of files is more than one, file path is first one. In other words, this is the value of path key of first struct whose selected key is true in the response of aria2.getFiles() RPC method. If you want to get all file paths, consider to use JSON-RPC/XML-RPC. Please note that file path may change during download in HTTP because of redirection or Content-Disposition header.

Let's see an example of how arguments are passed to command:

 
$ cat hook.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Called with [$1] [$2] [$3]"
$ aria2c --on-download-complete hook.sh http://example.org/file.iso
Called with [1] [1] [/path/to/file.iso]
 

EXIT STATUS¶ %HEADING%exit-statusexit-status-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Because aria2 can handle multiple downloads at once, it encounters lots of errors in a session. aria2 returns the following exit status based on the last error encountered.

0

:   If all downloads were successful.

1

:   If an unknown error occurred.

2

:   If time out occurred.

3

:   If a resource was not found.

4

:   If aria2 saw the specified number of "resource not found" error. See --max-file-not-found option.

5

:   If a download aborted because download speed was too slow. See --lowest-speed-limit option.

6

:   If network problem occurred.

7

:   If there were unfinished downloads. This error is only reported if all finished downloads were successful and there were unfinished downloads in a queue when aria2 exited by pressing Ctrl-C by an user or sending TERM or INT signal.

8

:   If remote server did not support resume when resume was required to complete download.

9

:   If there was not enough disk space available.

10

:   If piece length was different from one in .aria2 control file. See --allow-piece-length-change option.

11

:   If aria2 was downloading same file at that moment.

12

:   If aria2 was downloading same info hash torrent at that moment.

13

:   If file already existed. See --allow-overwrite option.

14

:   If renaming file failed. See --auto-file-renaming option.

15

:   If aria2 could not open existing file.

16

:   If aria2 could not create new file or truncate existing file.

17

:   If file I/O error occurred.

18

:   If aria2 could not create directory.

19

:   If name resolution failed.

20

:   If aria2 could not parse Metalink document.

21

:   If FTP command failed.

22

:   If HTTP response header was bad or unexpected.

23

:   If too many redirects occurred.

24

:   If HTTP authorization failed.

25

:   If aria2 could not parse bencoded file (usually ".torrent" file).

26

:   If ".torrent" file was corrupted or missing information that aria2 needed.

27

:   If Magnet URI was bad.

28

:   If bad/unrecognized option was given or unexpected option argument was given.

29

:   If the remote server was unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance.

30

:   If aria2 could not parse JSON-RPC request.

31

:   Reserved. Not used.

32

:   If checksum validation failed.

Note

An error occurred in a finished download will not be reported as exit status.

ENVIRONMENT¶ %HEADING%environmentenvironment-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2 recognizes the following environment variables.

http_proxy   [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]

:   Specify proxy server for use in HTTP. Overrides http-proxy value in configuration file. The command-line option --http-proxy overrides this value.

https_proxy   [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]

:   Specify proxy server for use in HTTPS. Overrides https-proxy value in configuration file. The command-line option --https-proxy overrides this value.

ftp_proxy   [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]

:   Specify proxy server for use in FTP. Overrides ftp-proxy value in configuration file. The command-line option --ftp-proxy overrides this value.

all_proxy   [http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]

:   Specify proxy server for use if no protocol-specific proxy is specified. Overrides all-proxy value in configuration file. The command-line option --all-proxy overrides this value.

Note

Although aria2 accepts ftp:// and https:// scheme in proxy URI, it simply assumes that http:// is specified and does not change its behavior based on the specified scheme.

no_proxy   [DOMAIN,...]

:   Specify a comma-separated list of host names, domains and network addresses with or without a subnet mask where no proxy should be used. Overrides the no-proxy value in configuration file. The command-line option --no-proxy overrides this value.

FILES¶ %HEADING%filesfiles-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2.conf¶ %HEADING%aria2-confaria2-conf-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

By default, aria2 checks whether the legacy path $HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf is present, otherwise it parses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf as its configuration file. You can specify the path to configuration file using --conf-path option. If you don't want to use the configuration file, use --no-conf option.

The configuration file is a text file and has 1 option per each line. In each line, you can specify name-value pair in the format: NAME=VALUE, where name is the long command-line option name without -- prefix. You can use same syntax for the command-line option. The lines beginning # are treated as comments:

 
# sample configuration file for aria2c %HEADING%sample-configuration-file-for-aria2c%HEADING% 
listen-port=60000
dht-listen-port=60000
seed-ratio=1.0
max-upload-limit=50K
ftp-pasv=true
 

Note

The confidential information such as user/password might be included in the configuration file. It is recommended to change file mode bits of the configuration file (e.g., chmod   600   aria2.conf), so that other user cannot see the contents of the file.

The environment variables, such as ${HOME}, are expanded by shell. This means that those variables used in configuration file are not expanded. However, it is useful to ${HOME} to refer user's home directory in configuration file to specify file paths. Therefore, aria2 expands ${HOME} found in the following option values to user's home directory:

ca-certificate
certificate
dht-file-path
dht-file-path6
dir
input-file
load-cookies
log
metalink-file
netrc-path
on-bt-download-complete
on-download-complete
on-download-error
on-download-start
on-download-stop
on-download-pause
out
private-key
rpc-certificate
rpc-private-key
save-cookies
save-session
server-stat-if
server-stat-of
torrent-file

Note that this expansion occurs even if the above options are used in the command-line. This means that expansion may occur 2 times: first, shell and then aria2c.

dht.dat¶ %HEADING%dht-datdht-dat-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Unless the legacy file paths $HOME/.aria2/dht.dat and $HOME/.aria2/dht6.dat are pointing to existing files, the routing table of IPv4 DHT is saved to the path $XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht.dat and the routing table of IPv6 DHT is saved to the path $XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht6.dat.

Netrc¶ %HEADING%netrcnetrc-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

Netrc support is enabled by default for HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP. To disable netrc support, specify --no-netrc option. Your .netrc file should have correct permissions(600).

If machine name starts ., aria2 performs domain-match instead of exact match. This is an extension of aria2. For example of domain match, imagine the following .netrc entry:

 
machine .example.org login myid password mypasswd
 

aria2.example.org domain-matches .example.org and uses myid and mypasswd.

Some domain-match example follow: example.net does not domain-match .example.org. example.org does not domain-match .example.org because of preceding .. If you want to match example.org, specify example.org.

Control File¶ %HEADING%control-filecontrol-file-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2 uses a control file to track the progress of a download. A control file is placed in the same directory as the downloading file and its file name is the file name of downloading file with .aria2 appended. For example, if you are downloading file.zip, then the control file should be file.zip.aria2. (There is a exception for this naming convention. If you are downloading a multi torrent, its control file is the "top directory" name of the torrent with .aria2 appended. The "top directory" name is a value of "name" key in "info" directory in a torrent file.)

Usually a control file is deleted once download completed. If aria2 decides that download cannot be resumed(for example, when downloading a file from a HTTP server which doesn't support resume), a control file is not created.

Normally if you lose a control file, you cannot resume download. But if you have a torrent or metalink with chunk checksums for the file, you can resume the download without a control file by giving -V option to aria2c in command-line.

Input File¶ %HEADING%input-fileinput-file-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

The input file can contain a list of URIs for aria2 to download. You can specify multiple URIs for a single entity: separate URIs on a single line using the TAB character.

Each line is treated as if it is provided in command-line argument. Therefore they are affected by --force-sequential and --parameterized-uri options.

Since URIs in the input file are directly read by aria2, they must not be quoted with single(') or double(") quotation.

Lines starting with # are treated as comments and skipped.

Additionally, the following options can be specified after each line of URIs. These optional lines must start with white space(s).

These options have exactly same meaning of the ones in the command-line options, but it just applies to the URIs it belongs to. Please note that for options in input file -- prefix must be stripped.

For example, the content of uri.txt is:

 
http://server/file.iso http://mirror/file.iso
  dir=/iso_images
  out=file.img
http://foo/bar
 

If aria2 is executed with -i   uri.txt   -d   /tmp options, then file.iso is saved as /iso_images/file.img and it is downloaded from http://server/file.iso and http://mirror/file.iso. The file bar is downloaded from http://foo/bar and saved as /tmp/bar.

In some cases, out parameter has no effect. See note of --out option for the restrictions.

Server Performance Profile¶ %HEADING%server-performance-profileserver-performance-profile-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

This section describes the format of server performance profile. The file is plain text and each line has several NAME=VALUE pair, delimited by comma. Currently following NAMEs are recognized:

host

:   Host name of the server. Required.

protocol

:   Protocol for this profile, such as ftp, http. Required.

dl_speed

:   The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec. Required.

sc_avg_speed

:   The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec. This value is only updated if the download is done in single connection environment and only used by AdaptiveURISelector. Optional.

mc_avg_speed

:   The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec. This value is only updated if the download is done in multi connection environment and only used by AdaptiveURISelector. Optional.

counter

:   How many times the server is used. Currently this value is only used by AdaptiveURISelector. Optional.

last_updated

:   Last contact time in GMT with this server, specified in the seconds since the Epoch(00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, UTC). Required.

status

:   ERROR is set when server cannot be reached or out-of-service or timeout occurred. Otherwise, OK is set.

Those fields must exist in one line. The order of the fields is not significant. You can put pairs other than the above; they are simply ignored.

An example follows:

 
host=localhost, protocol=http, dl_speed=32000, last_updated=1222491640, status=OK
host=localhost, protocol=ftp, dl_speed=0, last_updated=1222491632, status=ERROR
 

RPC INTERFACE¶ %HEADING%rpc-interfacerpc-interface-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

aria2 provides JSON-RPC over HTTP and XML-RPC over HTTP interfaces that offer basically the same functionality. aria2 also provides JSON-RPC over WebSocket. JSON-RPC over WebSocket uses the same method signatures and response format as JSON-RPC over HTTP, but additionally provides server-initiated notifications. See JSON-RPC over WebSocket section for more information.

The request path of the JSON-RPC interface (for both over HTTP and over WebSocket) is /jsonrpc. The request path of the XML-RPC interface is /rpc.

The WebSocket URI for JSON-RPC over WebSocket is ws://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc. If you enabled SSL/TLS encryption, use wss://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc instead.

The implemented JSON-RPC is based on JSON-RPC 2.0 <http://jsonrpc.org/specification>, and supports HTTP POST and GET (JSONP). The WebSocket transport is an aria2 extension.

The JSON-RPC interface does not support notifications over HTTP, but the RPC server will send notifications over WebSocket. It also does not support floating point numbers. The character encoding must be UTF-8.

When reading the following documentation for JSON-RPC, interpret structs as JSON objects.

Terminology¶ %HEADING%terminologyterminology-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

GID

The GID (or gid) is a key to manage each download. Each download will be assigned a unique GID. The GID is stored as 64-bit binary value in aria2. For RPC access, it is represented as a hex string of 16 characters (e.g., 2089b05ecca3d829). Normally, aria2 generates this GID for each download, but the user can specify GIDs manually using the --gid option. When querying downloads by GID, you can specify only the prefix of a GID as long as it is unique among others.

RPC authorization secret token¶ %HEADING%rpc-authorization-secret-tokenrpc-authorization-secret-token-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

As of 1.18.4, in addition to HTTP basic authorization, aria2 provides RPC method-level authorization. In a future release, HTTP basic authorization will be removed and RPC method-level authorization will become mandatory.

To use RPC method-level authorization, the user has to specify an RPC secret authorization token using the --rpc-secret option. For each RPC method call, the caller has to include the token prefixed with token:. Even when the --rpc-secret option is not used, if the first parameter in the RPC method is a string and starts with token:, it will removed from the parameter list before the request is being processed.

For example, if the RPC secret authorization token is secret, calling aria2.addUri RPC method would have to look like this:

 
aria2.addUri("token:$$secret$$", ["http://example.org/file"])
 

The system.multicall RPC method is treated specially. Since the XML-RPC specification only allows a single array as a parameter for this method, we don't specify the token in the call. Instead, each nested method call has to provide the token as the first parameter as described above.
Note

The secret token validation in aria2 is designed to take at least a certain amount of time to mitigate brute-force/dictionary attacks against the RPC interface. Therefore it is recommended to prefer Batch or system.multicall requests when appropriate.

system.listMethods and system.listNotifications can be executed without token. Since they just return available methods/notifications, they do not alter anything, they're safe without secret token.

Methods¶ %HEADING%methodsmethods-permalink-to-this-heading%HEADING%

All code examples are compatible with the Python 2.7 interpreter. For information on the secret parameter, see RPC authorization secret token.

aria2.
addUri
(
[
secret ,
]
uris
[,
options
[,
position
]
]
)
¶

:   This method adds a new download. uris is an array of HTTP/FTP/SFTP/BitTorrent URIs (strings) pointing to the same resource. If you mix URIs pointing to different resources, then the download may fail or be corrupted without aria2 complaining. When adding BitTorrent Magnet URIs, uris must have only one element and it should be BitTorrent Magnet URI. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See Options below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns the GID of the newly registered download.

 
**JSON-RPC Example**

The following example adds http://example.org/file:  

```
>>> import urllib2, json
>>> jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',
...                       'method':'aria2.addUri',
...                       'params':[['http://example.org/file']]})
>>> c = urllib2.urlopen('http://localhost:6800/jsonrpc', jsonreq)
>>> c.read()
'{"id":"qwer","jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"2089b05ecca3d829"}'
```

**XML-RPC Example**

The following example adds http://example.org/file:  

```
>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:6800/rpc')
>>> s.aria2.addUri(['http://example.org/file'])
'2089b05ecca3d829'
```

The following example adds a new download with two sources and some options:  

```
>>> s.aria2.addUri(['http://example.org/file', 'http://mirror/file'],
                    dict(dir="/tmp"))
'd2703803b52216d1'
```

The following example adds a download and inserts it to the front of the queue:  

```
>>> s.aria2.addUri(['http://example.org/file'], {}, 0)
'ca3d829cee549a4d'
```
 

aria2.
addTorrent
(
[
secret ,
]
torrent
[,
uris
[,
options
[,
position
]
]
]
)
¶

:   This method adds a BitTorrent download by uploading a ".torrent" file. If you want to add a BitTorrent Magnet URI, use the aria2.addUri() method instead. torrent must be a base64-encoded string containing the contents of the ".torrent" file. uris is an array of URIs (string). uris is used for Web-seeding. For single file torrents, the URI can be a complete URI pointing to the resource; if URI ends with /, name in torrent file is added. For multi-file torrents, name and path in torrent are added to form a URI for each file. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See Options below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns the GID of the newly registered download. If --rpc-save-upload-metadata is true, the uploaded data is saved as a file named as the hex string of SHA-1 hash of data plus ".torrent" in the directory specified by --dir option. E.g. a file name might be 0a3893293e27ac0490424c06de4d09242215f0a6.torrent. If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten! If the file cannot be saved successfully or --rpc-save-upload-metadata is false, the downloads added by this method are not saved by --save-session.

 
The following examples add local file file.torrent.

**JSON-RPC Example**  

```
>>> import urllib2, json, base64
>>> torrent = base64.b64encode(open('file.torrent').read())
>>> jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'asdf',
...                       'method':'aria2.addTorrent', 'params':[torrent]})
>>> c = urllib2.urlopen('http://localhost:6800/jsonrpc', jsonreq)
>>> c.read()
'{"id":"asdf","jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"2089b05ecca3d829"}'
```

**XML-RPC Example**  

```
>>> import xmlrpclib
>>> s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:6800/rpc')
>>> s.aria2.addTorrent(xmlrpclib.Binary(open('file.torrent', mode='rb').read()))

¶

:   This method adds a Metalink download by uploading a ".metalink" file. metalink is a base64-encoded string which contains the contents of the ".metalink" file. options is a struct and its members are pairs of option name and value. See Options below for more details. If position is given, it must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at position in the waiting queue. If position is omitted or position is larger than the current size of the queue, the new download is appended to the end of the queue. This method returns an array of GIDs of newly registered downloads. If --rpc-save-upload-metadata is true, the uploaded data is saved as a file named hex string of SHA-1 hash of data plus ".metalink" in the directory specified by --dir option. E.g. a file name might be 0a3893293e27ac0490424c06de4d09242215f0a6.metalink. If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten! If the file cannot be saved successfully or --rpc-save-upload-metadata is false, the downloads added by this method are not saved by --save-session.

 
The following examples add local file file.meta4.

**JSON-RPC Example**  

```
>>> import urllib2, json, base64
>>> metalink = base64.b64encode(open('file.meta4').read())
>>> jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',
...                       'method':'aria2.addMetalink',

gid
)
¶

:   This method removes the download denoted by gid (string). If the specified download is in progress, it is first stopped. The status of the removed download becomes removed. This method returns GID of removed download.

 
The following examples remove a download with GID![](color://2089b05e) #2089b05ecca3d829.

**JSON-RPC Example**  

```
>>> import urllib2, json
>>> jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',
...                       'method':'aria2.remove',
...                       'params':['2089b05ecca3d829']})

```
 

aria2.
forceRemove
(
[
secret ,
]
gid
)
¶

:   This method removes the download denoted by gid . This method behaves just like aria2.remove() except that this method removes the download without performing any actions which take time, such as contacting BitTorrent trackers to unregister the download first.

aria2.
pause
(
[
secret ,
]
gid
)
¶

:   This method pauses the download denoted by gid (string). The status of paused download becomes paused. If the download was active, the download is placed in the front of waiting queue. While the status is paused, the download is not started. To change status to waiting, use the aria2.unpause() method. This method returns GID of paused download.

aria2.
pauseAll
(
[

gid
[,
keys
]
)
¶

:   This method returns the progress of the download denoted by gid (string). keys is an array of strings. If specified, the response contains only keys in the keys array. If keys is empty or omitted, the response contains all keys. This is useful when you just want specific keys and avoid unnecessary transfers. For example, aria2.tellStatus("2089b05ecca3d829",   ["gid",   "status"]) returns the gid and status keys only. The response is a struct and contains following keys. Values are strings.

 
gid

:   GID of the download.


status

:   active for currently downloading/seeding downloads. waiting for downloads in the queue; download is not started. paused for paused downloads. error for downloads that were stopped because of error. complete for stopped and completed downloads. removed for the downloads removed by user.


totalLength

:   Total length of the download in bytes.


completedLength

:   Completed length of the download in bytes.


uploadLength

:   Uploaded length of the download in bytes.


bitfield

:   Hexadecimal representation of the download progress. The highest bit corresponds to the piece at index 0. Any set bits indicate loaded pieces, while unset bits indicate not yet loaded and/or missing pieces. Any overflow bits at the end are set to zero. When the download was not started yet, this key will not be included in the response.


downloadSpeed

:   Download speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.


uploadSpeed

:   Upload speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.


infoHash

:   InfoHash. BitTorrent only.


numSeeders

:   The number of seeders aria2 has connected to. BitTorrent only.


seeder

:   true if the local endpoint is a seeder. Otherwise false. BitTorrent only.


pieceLength

:   Piece length in bytes.


numPieces

:   The number of pieces.


connections

:   The number of peers/servers aria2 has connected to.


errorCode

:   The code of the last error for this item, if any. The value is a string. The error codes are defined in the [EXIT STATUS](#id1) section. This value is only available for stopped/completed downloads.


errorMessage

:   The (hopefully) human readable error message associated to errorCode.


followedBy

:   List of GIDs which are generated as the result of this download. For example, when aria2 downloads a Metalink file, it generates downloads described in the Metalink (see the [--follow-metalink](#cmdoption-follow-metalink) option). This value is useful to track auto-generated downloads. If there are no such downloads, this key will not be included in the response.


following

:   The reverse link for followedBy. A download included in followedBy has this object's GID in its following value.


belongsTo

:   GID of a parent download. Some downloads are a part of another download. For example, if a file in a Metalink has BitTorrent resources, the downloads of ".torrent" files are parts of that parent. If this download has no parent,#
